                <article> Look out for yourself, I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows for my mind to
                    run
                    around with my ear up to the ground.
                    I'm searching to behold the stories that are told When my back is to the world that was smiling when
                    I
                    turned tell you you're the greatest,
                    but once you turn, they hate us. Oh, the misery, everybody wants to be my enemy. Spare the sympathy,
                    everybody wants to be my enemy. Look out
                    for yourself, my enemy, look out for yourself. But I'm ready Your words up on the wall as you're
                    praying
                    for my fall and the laughter in the halls
                    and the names that I've been called I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
                    When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
                    Tell you, you're the greatest but once you turn, they hate us (ha). Oh, the misery
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy spare the sympathy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy. Look out for yourself, my enemy (yeah), look out for yourself
                    Uh, look, okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me. I'm praying that somebody hope for me
                    I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be, Posted, being a wreck of emotions.
                    Ready to go whenever, just let me know, The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
                    The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable. I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
                    They wanna plot on my trot to the top. I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box
                    I'm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock. To cause catastrophe and it matters more because I
                    had
                    it and I had a thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition, kinda shockin'.
                    They want a static with, precision, I'm automatic quarterback. I ain't talking sacking pack it, pack
                    it
                    up, I don't panic, batter-batter up Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat.
